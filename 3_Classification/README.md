# Classification 1

Dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients

1. Conduct standard data preprocessing:
 - Check for missed data/ outliers
 - Standardize if needed
 - Parse categorical/ numeric attributes
 - Describe data based on statistics / trait information 
2. Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
 - Highlight the first few components containing the most information
 - Give interpretation to these components
 - Use the results in further analysis 
3. Build classification models with target variable "default payment next month" 
 - KNN model
   - For a couple of examples of misclassification on a test sample, determine the nearest neighbors and explain why the mistake was made 
 - Logistic Regression model
   - Find the most significant coefficients, and what characteristics they relate to 
 - Decision Tree model
   - Show the structure of the constructed tree, identify the most important features 
 - Use cross-validation / split into training and test sets
 - Use appropriate metrics to measure quality
 - For each model, select the optimal hyperparameters
